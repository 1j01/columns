# Columns

A game about columns. And gems. But certainly not columns of gems.

What kind of game would that be, anyways? Doesn't really make sense.

Part of the [Bad Box Art](http://jams.gamejolt.io/badboxart) game jam.
[Play it on Game Jolt.](http://gamejolt.com/games/columns/136085)

Controls: Arrow keys or WASD.
You can double jump, even after walking off a column.

Collect gems and deposit them in the green checkpoint columns.
Get enough gems to unlock triple jump!

Press R to restart and get a new level,
M to toggle mute,
F to go fullscreen.
