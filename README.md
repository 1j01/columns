# Columns

A game about columns. And gems. But certainly not columns of gems.

What kind of game would that be, anyways? Doesn't really make sense.

Part of the [Bad Box Art](http://jams.gamejolt.io/badboxart) game jam.

Controls: Arrow keys or WASD.
You can double jump, even after walking off a column.
Get enough gems to unlock triple jump!
Press R to generate a new level.
